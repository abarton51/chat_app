# Network Programming Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of chat applications implemented in various programming languages. The main purpose of these projects is to learn and practice:

- TCP/UDP Protocol implementations
- Socket Programming
- Network Programming fundamentals
- Cross-language implementations of similar concepts

## Project Structure

Each chat application is organized in its own directory by programming language:

```
.
├── cchat_app/      # Chat application in C
├── rust_chat_app/  # Chat application in Rust
└── py_chat_app/    # Chat application in Python
```

## Project Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of network programming
- Learn how different languages handle socket programming
- Implement both TCP and UDP based communication
- Practice client-server architecture
- Compare implementation approaches across different languages

## Applications

### C Chat Application (cchat_app)
Basic chat application implemented in C, demonstrating low-level socket programming.

### Rust Chat Application (rust_chat_app)
Modern implementation of a chat system using Rust's safety features and async capabilities.

### Python Chat Application (py_chat_app)
Python-based chat application showcasing high-level network programming abstractions.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, you'll learn:
- How to create and manage network sockets
- Client-server communication patterns
- Data serialization and transmission
- Error handling in network applications
- Protocol design and implementation
- Cross-platform networking considerations

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own README with specific instructions for:
- Building the application
- Running the server
- Connecting clients
- Testing the implementation

## Prerequisites

Different projects require their respective language toolchains:
- C: gcc/clang compiler
- Rust: cargo and rustc
- Python: Python 3.x

## Contributing

Feel free to add implementations in other languages or improve existing ones!
